<!-- AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
When creating or refining an idea issue:

1. SKETCH SECTION:
   - Keep it light - this is brainstorming
   - What/Why/How should each be one sentence
   - Details can be rough notes

2. POTENTIAL VALUE:
   - Think about user benefit first
   - Business value second
   - Be honest about impact uncertainty

3. QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
   - Capture what you don't know
   - These become research tasks before refinement
   - Include feasibility, effort, and value questions

4. COMPLEXITY:
   - If XL or larger, note how to break it down
   - Ideas often seem smaller until investigated

5. STATUS TRACKING:
   - Ideas follow: Captured → Researched → Validated → Refined or Declined
   - "Refined" means it became a full feature issue
   - "Declined" with reason is valuable documentation

6. CONVERSION:
   - When idea is validated, create feature issue
   - Link the feature issue in "Refined" status
