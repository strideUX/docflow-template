# DocFlow Cloud Core Rules

This project uses **DocFlow Cloud**, a spec-driven development workflow with Linear integration.

## Essential Reading

**Read these files for complete rules:**

1. `.docflow/config.json` - Configuration (paths, provider settings)
2. `.docflow/rules/core.md` - Essential workflow rules
3. `.docflow/rules/` - Role-specific rules (load as needed)
4. `.docflow/skills/` - Portable workflow skills

## Quick Reference

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Commands |
|-------|----------|
| PM/Planning | capture, refine, activate, review, close, project-update, sync-project |
| Implementation | implement, block, attach |
| QE/Validation | validate |

### Critical Rules

- ❌ Never create local spec files - ALL specs live in Linear
- ✅ Context stays local in `{paths.content}/context/`
- ✅ Knowledge stays local in `{paths.content}/knowledge/`
- ✅ Update Linear, not local files for status/progress

### Configuration

Read `.docflow/config.json` for `paths.content` (default: "docflow").

**Load additional rules from `.docflow/rules/` based on context.**
