# DocFlow Cloud Workflow Rules

> Version: 3.0.0
> This file is synced from the DocFlow source repo. Run `/docflow-update` to check for updates.

## Overview

DocFlow Cloud is a hybrid spec-driven workflow:
- **Workflow state (specs)** → Lives in Linear
- **Understanding (context/knowledge)** → Lives locally in git
- **System rules (this file)** → Local, synced from central repo

---

## Context Loading Strategy

### On Every Interaction
1. **Check Linear** for "In Progress" issues (know current state)
2. **Scan Linear** for issues needing review (status=REVIEW)
3. **Scan Linear** for issues ready for QE (status=QA)

### When Starting/Planning New Work
**Load these to understand scope:**
- `docflow/context/overview.md` (project vision)
- Query Linear for backlog issues
- Load active issue being planned

### When Implementing
**Load these for execution context:**
- Current Linear issue (full description + comments)
- `docflow/context/stack.md` (technical patterns)
- `docflow/context/standards.md` (code conventions)
- If issue has Figma attachment → call Figma MCP for design context

### When Reviewing (status=REVIEW)
**Load these for quality assessment:**
- Linear issue being reviewed
- `docflow/context/standards.md` (code checklist)
- Implementation comments from Linear

### When Searching for Existing Code
- Use `codebase_search` to find patterns
- Use `grep` to find exact code
- Check `docflow/knowledge/` if search reveals relevant docs

### Knowledge Base (`docflow/knowledge/`)
- Scan `INDEX.md` first (provides overview)
- Load selectively based on task
- Never auto-load everything

## Status States

### Full Workflow (Features & Bugs)
```
BACKLOG → READY → IMPLEMENTING → REVIEW → TESTING → COMPLETE
   │         │          │           │         │         │
 Linear   Linear     Linear     Linear    Linear    Linear
Backlog    Todo    In Progress In Review    QA       Done
```

### Simplified Workflow (Chores & Ideas)
```
BACKLOG → ACTIVE → COMPLETE
   │         │         │
 Linear   Linear    Linear
Backlog In Progress  Done
```

---

## Agent Responsibilities

### PM/Planning Agent

**When Creating Specs:**
1. Create Linear issue with appropriate template
2. Set type label (feature, bug, chore, idea)
3. Set priority (1-4) based on urgency
4. Set estimate (1-5) based on complexity
5. Add Figma attachments if design exists
6. Leave in Backlog state
7. Add comment: `**Created** — [Brief context].`

**When Activating Work:**
1. Get developer username (git config)
2. Set priority if not already set (ask or infer)
3. Set estimate if not already set (ask or infer)
4. Assign Linear issue to developer
5. Move to "In Progress" state
6. Add comment: `**Activated** — Assigned to [name], Priority: [P], Estimate: [E].`

**When Reviewing (status=REVIEW):**
1. Check Linear for issues in "In Review" state
2. Read issue description + comments
3. Verify acceptance criteria met
4. Check code against standards
5. If approved:
   - Move to "QA" state
   - Add comment: "✅ Code review passed. Ready for QE testing."
6. If issues found:
   - Move back to "In Progress"
   - Add comment with specific changes needed

**When Closing (after QE approval):**
1. Move to "Done" state
2. Add comment: "✅ Completed and verified"

### Implementation Agent

**On Startup:**
1. Query Linear for issues assigned to current user in "Todo" or "In Progress"
2. If multiple, ask user which to work on
3. Read full issue including comments

**During Implementation:**
1. Update description checkboxes as criteria are completed
2. Add progress comments: `**Progress** — What was done.`
3. Document decisions in comments (dated)
4. If Figma attached: call Figma MCP for design specs

**On Completion:**
1. Verify all acceptance criteria checkboxes are checked
2. Move to "In Review" state
3. Add comment: `**Ready for Review** — [Brief summary]. Files: [count].`

**On Blocker:**
1. Add comment: `**Blocked** — [What's blocking and why].`
2. Tag PM/reviewer if needed

### QE/Validation Agent

**When Testing:**
1. Query Linear for issues in "QA" state
2. Guide user through testing acceptance criteria
3. Document test results in comments

**When User Approves:**
- Recognize approval phrases: "looks good", "approve", "ship it", "QE passed"
- Add approval comment
- Signal ready for PM to close

**When User Reports Issues:**
- Document issues in comment
- Move back to "In Progress"
- Add comment with specific bugs found

## Linear Integration

### Reading from Linear
```
Use Linear MCP to:
- Query issues by status, assignee, labels
- Read issue details including comments
- Get attachment URLs (Figma links, screenshots)
```

### Writing to Linear
```
Use Linear MCP to:
- Create new issues
- Update issue status, priority, estimate
- Update issue description (including checkboxes)
- Add comments
- Assign users
```

### Priority Values
| Value | Name    | Use When                          |
|-------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| 0     | None    | Not yet triaged                   |
| 1     | Urgent  | Drop everything, fix now          |
| 2     | High    | Next up, important                |
| 3     | Medium  | Normal priority (default)         |
| 4     | Low     | Nice to have, when time permits   |

### Estimate Values (Complexity)
| Value | Name | Rough Effort         |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| 1     | XS   | < 1 hour             |
| 2     | S    | 1-4 hours            |
| 3     | M    | Half day to full day |
| 4     | L    | 2-3 days             |
| 5     | XL   | Week+                |

### Acceptance Criteria as Checkboxes
Issue descriptions contain acceptance criteria as markdown checkboxes:
```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] First criterion
- [ ] Second criterion
- [x] Completed criterion
```

**During implementation:**
1. Read current description to see checkbox state
2. As each criterion is completed, update description with `[x]`
3. Use `update_issue` with full updated description
4. Add comment noting progress

**This keeps the issue as the single source of truth.**

### Comment Format
Use consistent comment format for audit trail:
```markdown
**Status** — Brief description of action taken.
```

Examples:
- `**Activated** — Assigned to Matt, Priority: High, Estimate: S.`
- `**Progress** — Completed data model, starting on hooks.`
- `**Blocked** — Waiting on API access from backend team.`
- `**Complete** — All acceptance criteria met.`

### Figma Integration
```
When issue has Figma attachment:
1. Extract fileKey and nodeId from URL
2. Call Figma MCP: get_design_context(fileKey, nodeId)
3. Use returned specs for implementation
```

### Configuration
```
Read .docflow.json for:
- teamId (required)
- initiativeId (optional scope)
- defaultProjectId (optional)
- label IDs for spec types
- state IDs for status mapping
```

### Environment Variables
```
Set in project .env file:

LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxx

Get key from: Linear → Settings → API → Personal API keys
Required for: Project updates (GraphQL API)

Load with: source .env
```

## Natural Language Triggers

### Start Session
"let's start" / "what's next" / "where are we" → `/start-session`

### Wrap Session
"wrap it up" / "I'm done" / "save progress" → `/wrap-session`

### Capture
"capture that" / "add to backlog" / "found a bug" → `/capture`

### Implement
"let's build" / "implement this" / "start working" → `/implement`

### Attach
"attach [file]" / "link the doc" / "upload notes" → `/attach`

### Validate
"test this" / "review implementation" → `/validate`

### QE Approval
"looks good" / "approve" / "ship it" / "QE passed" → Mark approved

### Project Update
"post project update" / "update project status" → `/project-update`

### Status
"what's the status" / "where are we" → `/status`

---

## Critical Rules

### Never Create Local Spec Files
- ❌ NO files in docflow/specs/ (directory doesn't exist)
- ❌ NO INDEX.md or ACTIVE.md files
- ✅ ALL specs live in Linear as issues

### Context Stays Local
- ✅ docflow/context/ always in git
- ✅ docflow/knowledge/ always in git
- These are version-controlled with code

### Update Linear, Not Local Files
- Status changes → Update Linear issue state
- Progress notes → Add Linear comment
- Decisions → Add dated Linear comment (format: `### YYYY-MM-DD - Decision Title`)
- Blockers → Add Linear comment and tag

### Document in Linear Comments
Format for implementation notes:
```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Implementation Progress

**Files Changed:**
- `path/to/file.tsx` - Added component

**Decisions:**
- Used pattern X because Y

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Remaining work
```

### Search Before Creating
- Use codebase_search to find existing code
- Check docflow/knowledge/ for existing patterns
- Avoid duplicating functionality

---

## Provider Abstraction

This workflow is designed to work with multiple PM tools. Linear is the first provider.

### What's Provider-Specific
- Issue creation/updates (via MCP)
- Status state names
- Label/tag system
- Comment format

### What's Provider-Agnostic
- Workflow stages (BACKLOG → COMPLETE)
- Agent roles and responsibilities
- Context loading strategy
- Local file structure

### Switching Providers
1. Update `.docflow.json` with new provider config
2. Update `.cursor/mcp.json` with new provider MCP
3. Workflow commands stay the same
