# Chore: [Short Descriptive Name]

<!-- 
AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
- This is a LIGHTWEIGHT template for maintenance, cleanup, and iterative improvements
- Replace [Short Descriptive Name] with kebab-case filename (e.g., "UI Polish" → chore-ui-polish.md)
- Fill initial task list, then ADD more tasks as you discover them while working
- Check off tasks [x] as you complete them
- This can be ONGOING - no need to rush to completion
- Update Status: BACKLOG → ACTIVE → COMPLETE (simplified workflow)
- NO formal QE step - just get user approval before marking COMPLETE
- If scope grows too large, suggest breaking into new chore or feature
- Check start date - if older than 2-3 weeks, suggest cleanup or closure
- Update Last Updated timestamp whenever you modify this file

## Context
<!-- 
AGENT: Explain WHY this work matters, even if it's internal/technical.
What improves? What gets easier? What technical debt does this address?
-->

**Why This Matters:**
[Explanation of the value - cleaner code, better UX, faster performance, etc.]

**Scope:**
[What areas/pages/features does this touch? Be specific enough to stay focused.]

**Related Work:**
- [Link to related feature if applicable]
- [Link to related chore if this is continuation]
- OR: [Standalone maintenance work]

## Task List
<!-- 
AGENT: Start with known tasks, ADD MORE as you discover them while working.
Check off [x] as you complete. Group related tasks if helpful.
This is YOUR working checklist - keep it updated!
-->

### Initial Tasks
- [ ] [Task 1 - be specific]
- [ ] [Task 2 - be specific]
- [ ] [Task 3 - be specific]

### Added During Work
<!-- As you work, add new tasks you discover here -->
- [ ] [New task discovered while working]
- [ ] [Another improvement opportunity found]

### Out of Scope (For Later)
<!-- Tasks that don't fit this chore - might become new chore/feature -->
- [ ] [Task that's too big or different focus]
- [ ] [Enhancement that needs its own spec]

---

## Work Notes
<!-- 
AGENT: Document as you work. Keep it loose - this isn't formal like feature specs.
Track: What you did, decisions made, problems solved, patterns discovered.
-->

### YYYY-MM-DD - [Work Session]
**Completed:**
- [What you finished]
- [What you improved]

**Decisions:**
- [Quick decision made and why]

**Discovered:**
- [New tasks to add above]
- [Issues found that need separate attention]

**Blockers:**
- [Anything blocking progress]
- OR: [No blockers]

## Files Changed
<!-- 
AGENT: Keep a running list of files touched during this chore.

**Created:**
- `path/to/new-file.tsx` - [What this is]

## Completion Criteria
<!-- 
AGENT: When do YOU think this is done? List it here.
Can be fuzzy - "Most UI issues addressed" is fine for iterative work.
When you think it's done, suggest completion to user but wait for approval.
-->

**This chore is done when:**
- [ ] [Completion criterion 1]
- [ ] [Completion criterion 2]
- [ ] [No obvious improvements remaining]
- [ ] [Code quality is acceptable]

**Signs this needs to be split or closed:**
- Work has been ongoing for 3+ weeks
- Scope has grown significantly from initial intent
- New tasks are unrelated to original purpose
- Better suited as a new chore or feature spec

---

## Agent Completion Check
<!-- 
AGENT: When you think the chore is complete, fill this section and ask user for approval.
Don't auto-close - wait for user confirmation.
-->

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

**Recommendation:**
[Should this close? Should remaining work become new chore? Should it stay open?]

---

## User Approval
<!-- 
USER: When agent suggests completion, review and decide.
Approve with: "looks good", "close this", "ship it"
Request more with: "keep going", "also do X", "not done yet"

## Notes & Observations
<!-- 
Capture learnings, patterns discovered, things to remember for next time.
These might become knowledge base docs or standards updates.
-->

**Patterns Discovered:**
- [Recurring pattern you found]
- [Better way to do something]

**Things to Document:**
- [ ] [Should this go in /docflow/knowledge/?]
- [ ] [Should this update standards.md?]

**Future Improvements:**
- [Ideas for related work later]
- [Things that are out of scope but worth noting]

---

**💡 Chore Philosophy:** This is iterative, ongoing work. It's OK if it takes time. It's OK if scope evolves. Just keep the list updated, check in periodically, and close it when it feels done.
