# Knowledge Base Index

Quick reference to all project knowledge. **Agents: scan this first** to find relevant docs, then load only what you need.

## 📋 Architecture Decisions

**Purpose:** Key architectural and technical decisions with rationale (ADRs)

- *No decisions documented yet*

<!-- Example:
- [001-why-convex.md] - Why we chose Convex over Supabase (2024-11-15)
- [002-document-sections.md] - Section-based document architecture (2024-11-20)
-->

## 🏗️ Feature Documentation

**Purpose:** Deep technical explanations of complex features

- *No feature docs yet*

<!-- Example:
- [sprint-planning.md] - How sprint capacity calculation works
- [real-time-sync.md] - Yjs and Convex real-time architecture
-->

---

## 👥 Product & UX

**Purpose:** User context, personas, flows, design guidelines

- [product/personas.md] - User personas and roles (template ready)
- [product/user-flows.md] - Key user journeys (template ready)

<!-- Add more as needed:
- [product/design-system.md] - Design patterns and guidelines
- [product/accessibility.md] - Accessibility requirements
-->

---

## 📝 Technical Notes

**Purpose:** Real-time discoveries, gotchas, workarounds

- *No notes yet*

<!-- Example:
- [notes/convex-gotchas.md] - Convex-specific quirks and workarounds
- [notes/blocknote-limitations.md] - BlockNote editor limitations
-->

## How to Use This Index

**For Agents:**
1. **Scan this file first** - it's lightweight (~500 tokens)
2. **Assess relevance** - use one-line descriptions to decide what to load
3. **Load selectively** - only read docs that apply to current task
4. **Never auto-load everything** - trust search and references

**When to Load Product Docs:**
- Creating user-facing features → load personas and relevant flows
- Planning UX → load design system and user flows
- Bug reports about UX → check user flows for expected behavior

**When to Load Technical Docs:**
- Implementing complex features → check if feature doc exists
- Making architectural decisions → review existing ADRs
- Encountering issues → check technical notes for gotchas

**When to Add New Docs:**
- Create ADRs in `decisions/` for architecture choices
- Document complex features in `features/`
- Capture UX artifacts in `product/`
- Record discoveries in `notes/`
